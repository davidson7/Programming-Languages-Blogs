Haskell experiences

While Haskell is generally easy to install, BNFC has some errors when checking for ghc version prerequisites.
After reading through several discussions on Github and stack exchange, the most reliable solution I can find is force installing an older version of ghc, although even that doesn't work all the time.

Recursive programming isn't a new concept but functional programming is more difficult than that. It reminds me of discrete math proofs and counting, with the concept of "next number" instead of "+1"
But the hardest thing about Haskell so far is the syntax. I know what I want to do, and I know it will work, and I can even write it out in mathematical notation, but I just don't know how to communicate that to the computer in Haskell.
Haskell's biggest difference may be the different programming paradigm, but personally the syntax is a bigger challenge.
For example, the lack of assignments makes it hard to read through code once and understand what's going on. Since I've only worked with imperative programming language, my brain understands '=' as assignment, but I can't use that shortcut anymore, and have to think longer and harder about what the code is doing.
