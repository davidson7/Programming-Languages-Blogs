# More Logic Puzzles from **How to Mock a Mockingbird** by Raymond M. Smullyan
## Only Three Words?



                       1 • John, James, and William
                We are given three brothers named John, James, and William.
            John and James (the two J's) always lie, but William always
            tells the truth. The three are indistinguishable in appearance.
            You meet one of the three brothers on the street one day and
            wish to find out whether he is John (because John owes you
            money). You are allowed to ask him one question answerable
            by yes or no, but the question may not contain more than
            three words! What question would you ask?
            
            
More important than the word restriction, let's first decide on what information we would need to isolate John and then how to get that information.
If we the three brothers if they are John, two will give 'No' answers, and only James will say 'Yes'. However this has isolated one liar, just the wrong brother.
So let's ask instead, "Are you James?" Because James must lie and say 'No', and William tells the truth and will say 'No', the only person who would answer 'Yes' is John, the brother we are looking for.


                      2 • A Variant
              Suppose we change the above conditions by making John and
            James both truthful and William a liar. Again you meet one
            of the three and wish to find out if he is John. Is there now a
            three-word yes/no question that can accomplish this?
            
            
Asking the same question "Are you James?" will give the opposite results, but the same pattern. John will still give a unique response, 'No'


                      3 • A More Subtle Puzzle
            We now have only two brothers (identical twins). One ofthem
          is named Arthur and the other has a different name. One of
          the two always lies and the other always tells the truth, but
          we are not told whether Arthur is the liar or the truth-teller.
          One day you meet the two brothers together, and you wish
          to find out which one is Arthur. Note that you are *not*
          interested in finding out which one lies and which one tells the
          truth, but only in finding out which one is Arthur. You are
          allowed to ask just one of them a question answerable by yes
          or no, and again the question may not contain more than three
          words. What question would you ask?

Without a third brother to identify the odd one out, we must find a question that will create a certain pattern.



We want Arthur to give a consistant, specific answer, whether he is a liar or not, so we can identify each brother. 
A good question to ask is "Does Arthur lie?" The question's subject will not change depending on who you ask, like in "Do you lie?" or "Does he lie?"
This question also works because though Arthur can either be a liar or not, which changes his answer, the quality of him *being* a liar, which is the answer to the question, also changes. So it is garunteed that Arthur will always answer 'No to the question "Is Arthur a liar?"


                          • 4 •
        Suppose that instead of wanting to find out which one is Arthur, 
      you want to find out whether Arthur is the liar or the
      truth-teller. Again there is a three-word question that will do
      this. What three-word question will work? There is a pretty
      symmetry between the solutions of this and the last problem!
