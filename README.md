### Our journey through Haskell and what we've learned in Programming Languages

* **How to Install Haskell an BNFC on Linux**
  * A step by step instructions to help users to install Haskell and BNFC on Linux
* **How to Install Haskell and BNFC on Windows**
  * A step by step instructions and visuals to help users to install Haskell and BNFC on Windows
* **BExp Grammar, Interpreter, bMergeSort (3)**
  * For the extra credit, we got to explore, research, and learn how to add boolean features to LambdaNat. In our  grammar, we added a new type of expressions, BExp and included operations and, or, not as well as ==, <=, <, >, >=. In our interpreter, we implemented boolean evaluate functions, evalBool. In our bMergeSort, we rewrote the mergeSort of Assignment 2 in this new language for testing.

* **LambdaFun Features (3)**
  * List (delete, update, insert)
  * ==, <=, <, >, >= operations
  * add, sub, mult, and div operations
